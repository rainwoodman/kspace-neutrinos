==About this code==
This code is an extension for Gadget-3 to allow the cheap inclusion of massive neutrinos.
It implements the linear response method detailed in Ali-Haimoud & Bird 2013 (arxiv:1209.0461)
and the hybrid neutrino method in Bird & Ali-Haimoud 2017 (in prep). It has a full test suite, 
which can be run with 'make test' and aims to be easily portable to a variety of different codes.
You are welcome to use it as desired, but please cite Ali-Haimoud & Bird 2013, and 
Bird & Ali-Haimoud 2017 if you use the hybrid neutrinos.

==Parameters of the code==

The neutrino linear response code takes the following parameters, which should 
be set in the parameter file of your N-body code. Parameter file name shows the default key 
as written in the parameter file, while internal variable gives the member of the 
kspace_params structure in kspace_neutrinos_2.c . Default values are given where relevant:

                                                                but CAMB's does not.

INTS:

Note that total_powerspectrum returns a power spectrum which is in units of the box, and unnormalised, 
that is, P(k) * N^2, where N is the number of modes in each bin. After investigation, no attempt 
is made to smooth the power spectrum by averaging neighbouring bins.

==Porting the neutrino library to a new code==

This version of the neutrino integration library is written
to be easy to port to different versions of Gadget, or other 
non-Gadget-based N-body codes. However, due to the wide 
variety of codes in use, some manual adjustment may still be necessary.
This document details the steps to take.

All interfacing between the neutrino integrator and the rest of 
the code goes through the routines in kspace_neutrinos_2.c 
and kspace_neutrinos_2.h Ideally therefore, you should just 
call these routines at the correct points in your code 
and add the .c files to your Makefile. 
Note we do not use global Gadget variables, nor Gadget configuration switches.

The three main routines are:
OmegaNu(a): the matter density in neutrinos, should be added to the Hubble function
allocate_kspace_memory(): allocates and sets up the neutrino module. Do it before calling OmegaNu.
add_nu_power_to_rhogrid(): call this inside your PM routine to add the neutrino power to the grid,
Further documentation is provided inside kspace_neutrinos_2.h

Note that add_nu_power_to_rhogrid assumes the (slab-decomposed) FFTW 2, with a type complex number type fftw_complex,
as this is used in almost all gadget versions. If this does not match your code, you will need to alter 
powerspectrum.c (or use a power spectrum routine built into your code) and change the loop on line 225 
of kspace_neutrinos_2.c just after init_delta_pow.

The .c files which need to be compiled in are:
delta_pow.c - GSL interpolation for neutrino power spectra
delta_tot_table.c - Core integrator that computes delta_nu given a matter power spectrum.
kspace_neutrinos_2.c - Routines to do the messy business of interfacing with Gadget. 
                       Also stores the state for the neutrino code in the form of global variables.
omega_nu_single.c -  Routines to compute OmegaNu and OmegaR 
powerspectrum.c - Routine to compute the power spectrum of a Fourier-transformed density field, 
                    divided up between processors as by FFTW2.
transfer_init.c - Routine to read and parse CAMB formatter transfer functions.

Other c files are: 
*_test.c - cmocka tests for each module.
gadget_defines.c - support infrastructure normally in gadget for the tests.

You should also provide a routine to read the parameters required 
by the neutrino integrator from your code's parameter file. 
An example routine for Gadget-3 called set_kspace_vars is provided in
kspace_neutrinos_2.h

Your code should provide the routines declared in gadget_defines.h.
These are:
mymalloc, myfree - free and allocate memory.
hubble_function - H(a)
terminate - ends the simulation.
In case your code does not provide them, there are simple examples 
defined in gadget_defines.c, primarily for the test suite.
