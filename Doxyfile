# Doxyfile 1.5.9

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project
#
# All text after a hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored
# The format is:
#       TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists items can also be appended using:
#       TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (" ")

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Project related configuration options
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file 
# that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all 
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the 
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See 
# http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv for the list of possible encodings.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded 
# by quotes) that should identify the project.

PROJECT_NAME           = kspace-neutrinos

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. 
# This could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or 
# if some version control system is used.

PROJECT_NUMBER         = 1

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) 
# base path where the generated documentation will be put. 
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location 
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = doc

# If the CREATE_SUBDIRS tag is set to YES, then doxygen will create 
# 4096 sub-directories (in 2 levels) under the output directory of each output 
# format and will distribute the generated files over these directories. 
# Enabling this option can be useful when feeding doxygen a huge amount of 
# source files, where putting all generated files in the same directory would 
# otherwise cause performance problems for the file system.

CREATE_SUBDIRS         = NO

# The OUTPUT_LANGUAGE tag is used to specify the language in which all 
# documentation generated by doxygen is written. 
OUTPUT_LANGUAGE        = English

# If the BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will 
# include brief member descriptions after the members that are listed in 
# the file and class documentation (similar to JavaDoc). 
# Set to NO to disable this.

BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC      = YES

# If the REPEAT_BRIEF tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will prepend 
# the brief description of a member or function before the detailed description. 
# Note: if both HIDE_UNDOC_MEMBERS and BRIEF_MEMBER_DESC are set to NO, the 
# brief descriptions will be completely suppressed.

REPEAT_BRIEF           = YES

# If the FULL_PATH_NAMES tag is set to YES then Doxygen will prepend the full 
# path before files name in the file list and in the header files. If set 
# to NO the shortest path that makes the file name unique will be used.

FULL_PATH_NAMES        = NO

# The MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF tag can be set to YES to make Doxygen 
# treat a multi-line C++ special comment block (i.e. a block of //! or /// 
# comments) as a brief description. This used to be the default behaviour. 
# The new default is to treat a multi-line C++ comment block as a detailed 
# description. Set this tag to YES if you prefer the old behaviour instead.

MULTILINE_CPP_IS_BRIEF = NO

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C 
# sources only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. 
# For instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list 
# of all members will be omitted, etc.

OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C  = YES

# When TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT is enabled, a typedef of a struct, union, or enum 
# is documented as struct, union, or enum with the name of the typedef. So 
# typedef struct TypeS {} TypeT, will appear in the documentation as a struct 
# with name TypeT. When disabled the typedef will appear as a member of a file, 
# namespace, or class. And the struct will be named TypeS. This can typically 
# be useful for C code in case the coding convention dictates that all compound 
# types are typedef'ed and only the typedef is referenced, never the tag name.

TYPEDEF_HIDES_STRUCT   = YES

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES all private members of a class 
# will be included in the documentation.

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES all static members of a file 
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = NO

# If the EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES tag is set to YES classes (and structs) 
# defined locally in source files will be included in the documentation. 
# If set to NO only classes defined in header files are included.

EXTRACT_LOCAL_CLASSES  = NO

# If the HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS tag is set to YES, Doxygen will hide any 
# documentation blocks found inside the body of a function. 
# If set to NO (the default) these blocks will be appended to the 
# function's detailed documentation block.

HIDE_IN_BODY_DOCS      = NO

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then Doxygen will only generate 
# file names in lower-case letters. If set to YES upper-case letters are also 
# allowed. This is useful if you have classes or files whose names only differ 
# in case and if your file system supports case sensitive file names. Windows 
# and Mac users are advised to set this option to NO.

CASE_SENSE_NAMES       = YES

# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or 
# disable (NO) the todo list. This list is created by putting \todo 
# commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_TODOLIST      = YES

# The GENERATE_TESTLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or 
# disable (NO) the test list. This list is created by putting \test 
# commands in the documentation.

# commands in the documentation.

GENERATE_BUGLIST       = YES

# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated 
# at the bottom of the documentation of classes and structs. If set to YES the 
# list will mention the files that were used to generate the documentation.

SHOW_USED_FILES        = YES

# Set the SHOW_FILES tag to NO to disable the generation of the Files page. 
# This will remove the Files entry from the Quick Index and from the 
# Folder Tree View (if specified). The default is YES.

SHOW_FILES             = YES

# Set the SHOW_NAMESPACES tag to NO to disable the generation of the 
# Namespaces page. 
# This will remove the Namespaces entry from the Quick Index

WARNINGS               = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the 
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp 
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left 
# blank the following patterns are tested: 
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh *.hxx 
# *.hpp *.h++ *.idl *.odl *.cs *.php *.php3 *.inc *.m *.mm *.py *.f90

FILE_PATTERNS          = *.cpp *.hpp *.c *.h

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to turn specify whether or not subdirectories 
# should be searched for input files as well. Possible values are YES and NO. 
# If left blank NO is used.

RECURSIVE              = YES

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should 
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a 
# subdirectory from a directory tree whose root is specified with the INPUT tag.

EXCLUDE                = python perl doc

# The EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS tag can be used select whether or not files or

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES

# Setting the INLINE_SOURCES tag to YES will include the body 
# of functions and classes directly in the documentation.

INLINE_SOURCES         = NO

# Otherwise they will link to the documentation.

REFERENCES_LINK_SOURCE = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the alphabetical class index
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML_OUTPUT            = html

USE_MATHJAX = YES


# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index 
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. 
# If the tag value is set to FRAME, a side panel will be generated 
# containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that 
# is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports 
# JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required (for instance Mozilla 1.0+, 
# Netscape 6.0+, Internet explorer 5.0+, or Konqueror). Windows users are 
# probably better off using the HTML help feature. Other possible values 
# for this tag are: HIERARCHIES, which will generate the Groups, Directories, 
# and Class Hierarchy pages using a tree view instead of an ordered list; 
# ALL, which combines the behavior of FRAME and HIERARCHIES; and NONE, which 
# disables this behavior completely. For backwards compatibility with previous 
# releases of Doxygen, the values YES and NO are equivalent to FRAME and NONE 
# respectively.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the LaTeX output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will

# configuration options for the AutoGen Definitions output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the GENERATE_AUTOGEN_DEF tag is set to YES Doxygen will

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options related to the dot tool   
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is 
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz, a graph visualization 
# toolkit from AT&T and Lucent Bell Labs. The other options in this section 
# have no effect if this option is set to NO (the default)

HAVE_DOT               = YES

# If the CLASS_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen 
# will generate a graph for each documented class showing the direct and 
# indirect inheritance relations. Setting this tag to YES will force the 
# the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag to NO.

CLASS_GRAPH            = NO

# If the COLLABORATION_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen 
# will generate a graph for each documented class showing the direct and 
# indirect implementation dependencies (inheritance, containment, and 
# class references variables) of the class with other documented classes.

COLLABORATION_GRAPH    = NO

# If the CALL_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT options are set to YES then 
# doxygen will generate a call dependency graph for every global function 
# or class method. Note that enabling this option will significantly increase 
# the time of a run. So in most cases it will be better to enable call graphs 
# for selected functions only using the \callgraph command.

CALL_GRAPH             = YES

# If the CALLER_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then 
# doxygen will generate a caller dependency graph for every global function

GRAPHICAL_HIERARCHY    = YES

# If the DIRECTORY_GRAPH, SHOW_DIRECTORIES and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES 
# then doxygen will show the dependencies a directory has on other directories 
# in a graphical way. The dependency relations are determined by the #include 
# relations between the files in the directories.

DIRECTORY_GRAPH        = NO

# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES allow dot to generate multiple output 
# files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This 
# makes dot run faster, but since only newer versions of dot (>1.8.10) 
# support this, this feature is disabled by default.

DOT_MULTI_TARGETS      = YES

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Options related to the search engine
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
